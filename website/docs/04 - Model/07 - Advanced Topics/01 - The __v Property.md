# The \_\_v Property

The `__v` property of a `Model` instance is a special internal value which indicates the "version" of the data that the `Model` was instantiated from during database read operations. It is generated by generating a hash of the record after it was read from disk. The `__v` property exists on all `Model` instances and is accessible to consumers of the `Model`.

## How Its Used

The `__v` property is primarily used during save operations in order to ensure that the current state of the data has not changed since the `Model` was instantiated. In order to ensure data integrity, MVOM will reject saves where the contents of a record has changed between the time a `Model` instance was created and the time the record is written to disk. If MVOM detects that a record has changed it will abort the save attempt and throw a `DocumentVersionMismatchError`.
